Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is my pet project called Meals order project

Description:
Basically, this project clone how to order application works, and I just cloning sessions of ordering the meal from app, and asking client to providing the informations of them to make an order and send it to theirs email

This pet project based on: React for UI and managing states, and Express.js for API calling to perform the data for React.

Mainly, in this pet project Im using all of things I learned and started to use it into this project, all of basic React's concepts: Component, Props, Context API, Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef...), also some techniques like custom Hooks, props drilling,...

This pet project just test my knowledge how the React's Lifecycle works, and just like small test to creating an web application with React.

If there have anything isn't right, just comment inside my code

Thank you.
